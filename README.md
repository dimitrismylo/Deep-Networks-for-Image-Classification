# Deep Networks for Image Classification

This repository contains an exploration of deep convolutional networks for image classification. The original [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) and [ResNet-18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) models are implemented in PyTorch and improvements are proposed based on architectural changes and alternative training strategies. 

The evaluation of the models is performed on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) handwritten digits and [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) datasets. 

A paper is also compiled, which contains a description of the model architectures, the training and experimentation processes, and an analysis of the results for both the original and improved versions of the networks.
